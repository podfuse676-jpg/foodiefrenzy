# Services Restart Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. PowerShell Script Path Issue
- **Problem**: The run-all.ps1 script was using the wrong method to determine the current directory
- **Solution**: Updated the script to use `$MyInvocation.MyCommand.Path` to correctly identify the script's directory

### 2. Backend Startup Command
- **Problem**: The script was trying to run `npm start` which doesn't exist in the backend
- **Solution**: Changed the backend startup command from `npm start` to `node server.js`

### 3. Directory Navigation
- **Problem**: The script was getting confused about directory paths when run from different locations
- **Solution**: Used `Split-Path -Parent $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Path` to get the absolute path of the script directory

## Future Startup

To start all services in the future:

2. Run the command: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "run-all.ps1"`
3. Wait for all services to start (you'll see the success message)
4. Access the services at their respective URLs

## Troubleshooting Tips

If you encounter issues in the future:
1. Check that MongoDB is running
2. Verify that no other services are using the required ports (4000, 5173, 5174)
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed by running `npm install` in each directory (frontend, backend, admin)
4. Check the terminal outputs for any error messages
