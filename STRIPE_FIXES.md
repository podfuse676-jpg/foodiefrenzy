# Stripe Configuration Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Hardcoded Frontend URLs in Stripe Checkout

**Problem**: Stripe checkout session was using hardcoded localhost:5173 URLs, but the frontend was running on a different port (5181).
**Solution**:

- Updated the backend to use `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable
- Added fallback to default localhost:5173 if not configured
- Updated success and cancel URLs to use dynamic frontend URL

### 2. Environment Variable Configuration

**Problem**: While Stripe key was present, the URLs were not configurable.
**Solution**:

- Added support for `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable in backend
- Updated .env file with proper frontend URL configuration

## Files Modified

1. [backend/controllers/orderController.js](file:///Users/quick/Downloads/FOODIEFRENZY/backend/controllers/orderController.js) - Updated Stripe checkout session URLs
2. [backend/.env](file:///Users/quick/Downloads/FOODIEFRENZY/backend/.env) - Added/verified frontend URL configuration

## Key Improvements

### Dynamic URL Configuration

- Uses environment variables for frontend URL configuration
- Falls back to default URL if not configured
- Supports different deployment environments

### Better Error Handling

- Maintains proper error messages for Stripe configuration issues
- Preserves existing functionality for COD payments

### Environment Flexibility

- Supports local development with different ports
- Ready for production deployment with custom URLs

## Testing Verification

The fixes should resolve:

- "Stripe not configured on server" errors during card payments
- Redirect issues after Stripe payment completion
- Incorrect return URLs for payment success/cancel

## Environment Configuration
