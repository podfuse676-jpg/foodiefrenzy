## Technical Notes

### Data Structure

- `gst`: GST rate percentage (if applicable)
- `modifierGroups`: Array of modifier groups for customization
- `variants`: Array of size/variant options

### Component Structure
```
OurMenu
├── MenuItem (for each item in grid)
│   └── ItemDetailView (when item is clicked)
└── CustomizePopup (for backward compatibility)
```

## Testing

To verify the implementation:

1. Check that each item displays its price, tax, and GST information

4. Test that clicking an item opens the detailed view
5. Ensure the detailed view shows all relevant information
6. Verify that the add-to-cart functionality works correctly
