# Running Services Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. API URL Configuration
- **Problem**: The frontend was configured to use a remote API URL instead of localhost
- **Solution**: Updated [apiConfig.js](file:///c:/Users/YASHASVI/Downloads/FOODIEFRENZY/FOODIEFRENZY/frontend/src/utils/apiConfig.js) and [.env](file:///c:/Users/YASHASVI/Downloads/FOODIEFRENZY/FOODIEFRENZY/frontend/.env) files to use `http://localhost:4000`

### 2. Environment Configuration
- **Problem**: Backend [.env](file:///c:/Users/YASHASVI/Downloads/FOODIEFRENZY/FOODIEFRENZY/frontend/.env) file was configured for production with remote URLs
- **Solution**: Updated backend [.env](file:///c:/Users/YASHASVI/Downloads/FOODIEFRENZY/FOODIEFRENZY/frontend/.env) to use development settings with localhost URLs

### 3. Service Startup Issues
- **Problem**: Services were not running due to configuration issues
- **Solution**: Manually started each service (backend, frontend, admin) in separate terminals

## Current Status

All services are now running successfully:

1. **Backend API Service**: http://localhost:4000
   - MongoDB connected successfully
   - Server listening on port 4000

2. **Frontend Service**: http://localhost:5173
   - Vite development server running
   - Connected to backend API

3. **Admin Panel Service**: http://localhost:5174
   - Vite development server running
   - Connected to backend API

## Verification Steps

1. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173 (Frontend)
2. You should see the Foodie Frenzy website with the menu categories
3. Navigate to http://localhost:5174 (Admin Panel) for admin functionality
4. The backend API is accessible at http://localhost:4000

## Features Working

1. Main navigation with "Products" category (renamed from "Grocery")
2. Sub-category navigation for Products:
   - Hot Beverages
   - Cold Beverages
   - Hot Food
   - Exotic Chips
   - Exotic Drinks
   - Grocery
   - Novelties
   - Car Accessories
   - Smokes & Vapes
3. Detailed item view modal when clicking on any menu item
4. Modifier selection and add to cart functionality
5. Responsive design for both desktop and mobile

## Next Steps

To make this easier to start in the future, you can use the existing run scripts:
1. Run `run-all.ps1` from the project root to start all services at once
2. Make sure to update the .env files if you need to switch between development and production environments

## Troubleshooting Tips

If you encounter issues in the future:
1. Check that MongoDB is running
2. Verify that the .env files have the correct URLs for your environment
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed by running `npm install` in each directory (frontend, backend, admin)
4. Check the terminal outputs for any error messages
