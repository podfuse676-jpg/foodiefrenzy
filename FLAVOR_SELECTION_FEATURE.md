# Flavor Selection Feature Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the flavor selection feature for menu items in the Foodie Frenzy application. The feature allows customers to select flavor options for applicable menu items directly from the menu grid or in the detailed item view.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Flavor Selection in Menu Grid
- For items with flavor options, a "Select Flavors" button is displayed
- Clicking the button reveals flavor checkboxes in a collapsible section
- Users can select multiple flavors using custom-styled checkboxes
- Selected flavors are visually indicated with a green checkmark
- Flavors are passed to the cart when the item is added

### 2. Flavor Selection in Detailed View
- Items with flavor options show a dedicated "Flavor Options" section
- Custom-styled checkboxes with clear visual feedback
- Support for multiple flavor selection
- Selected flavors are passed to the cart when added

### 3. Cart Integration
- Selected flavors are stored with cart items
- Flavors are preserved when items are updated or removed
- Backend API integration for authenticated users
- Local storage fallback for non-authenticated users

### 4. Accessibility
- Proper aria-labels for screen readers
- Keyboard navigable checkboxes
- Clear visual feedback for selections
- Responsive design for all device sizes

## Technical Implementation

### Components

#### 1. FlavorSelection Component
A reusable component that displays flavor options as styled checkboxes:

```jsx
<FlavorSelection
  flavors={item.flavourOptions}
  selectedFlavors={selectedFlavors}
  onFlavorChange={handleFlavorChange}
  multipleSelection={true}
  title="Flavor Options"
/>
```

**Props:**
- `flavors`: Array of flavor options
- `selectedFlavors`: Array of currently selected flavors
- `onFlavorChange`: Callback function when selection changes
- `multipleSelection`: Boolean to allow multiple selections
- `title`: Section title

#### 2. MenuItem Component
Updated to include flavor selection in the grid view:

- Added state for selected flavors and visibility toggle
- Integrated flavor selection component in a collapsible section
- Updated cart integration to include selected flavors

#### 3. ItemDetailView Component
Updated to include flavor selection in the detailed view:

- Added state for selected flavors
- Integrated flavor selection component
- Updated cart integration to include selected flavors

#### 4. CartContext
Updated to handle flavor selections:

- Modified state structure to include `selectedFlavors`
- Updated `addToCart` and `updateQuantity` functions to accept flavors
- Updated reducer to manage flavor state

### Styling

#### Custom Checkboxes
- Styled checkboxes with green border and background when selected
- Clear visual indication with checkmark icon
- Hover states for better user feedback
- Consistent styling with the rest of the application

#### Responsive Design
- Grid layout adapts to different screen sizes
- Scrollable flavor selection area for items with many options
- Appropriate spacing and sizing for touch targets

### Data Flow

1. **Flavor Data Source**: `item.flavourOptions` array from backend
2. **Selection State**: Managed in component state (`selectedFlavors`)
3. **User Interaction**: Clicking checkboxes toggles selection
4. **Cart Integration**: Selected flavors passed to `addToCart` function
5. **Persistence**: Flavors stored with cart items in localStorage/API

## Usage Examples

### Items with Flavors
For items like "Coffee" or "Slushy" with flavor options:
- Display "Select Flavors" button in grid view
- Show flavor checkboxes when expanded
- Allow multiple selections
- Pass selected flavors to cart

### Items without Flavors
For items without flavor options:
- Display "No flavours for this item" message
- Hide flavor selection UI
- Standard add to cart functionality

## Testing Verification

The implementation has been verified to ensure:

- ✅ Flavor options display correctly for items with `flavourOptions`
- ✅ Custom checkboxes show clear selection states
- ✅ Multiple flavor selection works as expected
- ✅ Selected flavors are passed to the cart
- ✅ Flavors are preserved in cart items
- ✅ UI is responsive and accessible
- ✅ No flavor UI shows for items without flavor options
- ✅ Consistent styling with the rest of the application

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:

1. **Single Flavor Selection**: Add option to restrict to one flavor selection
2. **Flavor Pricing**: Implement additional costs for premium flavors
3. **Flavor Categories**: Group flavors by type (e.g., fruit, nut, spice)
4. **Search/Filter**: Add search functionality for items with many flavors
5. **Visual Flavor Indicators**: Add color coding or icons for different flavor types
