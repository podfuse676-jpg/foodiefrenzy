### Search and Filtering
- Items can be searched by name across all categories
- Results show items matching the search term
- Categories can be browsed individually
- All items display their correct pricing information

## Technical Implementation

### Category Assignment Logic
1. Each item is checked against keywords for each category
2. The first matching category is assigned
3. Items that don't match any category go to "Uncategorized"
4. Category order is maintained as specified

### Data Structure
- Items are organized in a dictionary with categories as keys
- Each category contains an array of items
- Items retain all their properties (name, price, description, variants, modifiers)
- Search functionality works across all categories

### UI/UX Considerations
- Each category has distinct visual styling
- Items with customization options show "Customize" button
- Items without options show "Add" button directly
- Responsive design works on all device sizes
- Clear visual hierarchy and navigation
