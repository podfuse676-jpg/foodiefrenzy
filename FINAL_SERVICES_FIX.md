# Final Services Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Directory Path Issues
- **Problem**: The PowerShell terminal was having issues with directory paths and commands
- **Solution**: Created a batch file to properly start all services with correct directory navigation

### 2. Service Startup Method
- **Problem**: Previous attempts to start services were failing due to path resolution issues
- **Solution**: Used a batch file with explicit `cd /d` commands to ensure correct directory changes

### 3. Process Management
- **Problem**: Previous node processes may have been interfering with new startups
- **Solution**: Ensured all node processes were terminated before starting fresh services

   - Vite development server running
   - Connected to backend API

3. **Admin Panel Service**: http://localhost:5174
   - Vite development server running
   - Connected to backend API

## How to Access

## Future Startup

To start all services in the future:
1. Navigate to the project root directory
2. Run the command: `Start-Process -FilePath "start-services.bat"`
3. Wait for all services to start
4. Access the services at their respective URLs

## Troubleshooting Tips

If you encounter issues in the future:
1. Check that MongoDB is running
2. Verify that no other services are using the required ports (4000, 5173, 5174)
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed by running `npm install` in each directory (frontend, backend, admin)
4. Check the terminal outputs for any error messages
5. If services fail to start, run `taskkill /f /im node.exe` to terminate any existing node processes
