# Frontend Alignment Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. The rotating dishes (orbiting images) in the banner had alignment issues
2. The orbit animation was not responsive across different screen sizes
3. Image sizes were not properly scaled for different devices

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated CSS Animations ([frontend/src/index.css](file:///Users/quick/Downloads/FOODIEFRENZY/frontend/src/index.css))

- Adjusted the orbit animation radius for better positioning
- Added responsive breakpoints for different screen sizes:
  - Small screens (mobile): 80px orbit radius
  - Medium screens (tablet): 120px orbit radius (default)
  - Large screens (desktop): 150px orbit radius
- Improved the animation smoothness

### 2. Enhanced Banner Component ([frontend/src/components/Banner/Banner.jsx](file:///Users/quick/Downloads/FOODIEFRENZY/frontend/src/components/Banner/Banner.jsx))

- Improved responsive layout using flexbox
- Added better responsive sizing for all images:
  - Main banner image: responsive sizing from 200px to 350px
  - Orbiting images: responsive sizing from 60px to 120px
- Enhanced the layout structure for better alignment on all devices
- Improved the search form and button alignment
- Added better responsive classes for text alignment

### 3. Key Improvements

- Better centering of orbiting images around the main banner image
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
- Improved visual hierarchy and spacing
- Enhanced mobile experience with appropriate image sizing
- Better alignment of text and form elements

## Current Status

The frontend is now running on http://localhost:5176 with improved alignment and responsive behavior for the rotating dishes feature.

## Testing Recommendations

1. Check the banner on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
2. Verify that orbiting images are properly centered around the main image
3. Confirm that all text and form elements are properly aligned
4. Test the search functionality to ensure it works correctly

## Reference

These changes follow the project's Tailwind CSS setup and responsive design principles.
