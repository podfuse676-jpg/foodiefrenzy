# Website Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Component Import Issue
- **Problem**: The [OurMenu.jsx](file:///c:/Users/YASHASVI/Downloads/FOODIEFRENZY/FOODIEFRENZY/frontend/src/components/OurMenu/OurMenu.jsx) file had a duplicate component definition. It was importing [MenuItemDetail](file:///c:/Users/YASHASVI/Downloads/FOODIEFRENZY/FOODIEFRENZY/frontend/src/components/OurMenu/MenuItemDetail.jsx) but also had an inline [ItemDetail](file:///c:/Users/YASHASVI/Downloads/FOODIEFRENZY/FOODIEFRENZY/frontend/src/components/OurMenu/OurMenu.jsx#L338-L538) component defined.
- **Solution**: Removed the inline component definition and kept the proper import statement for [MenuItemDetail](file:///c:/Users/YASHASVI/Downloads/FOODIEFRENZY/FOODIEFRENZY/frontend/src/components/OurMenu/MenuItemDetail.jsx).

### 2. Unnecessary Context Import
- **Problem**: The file was importing `useContext` and [CartContext](file:///c:/Users/YASHASVI/Downloads/FOODIEFRENZY/FOODIEFRENZY/frontend/src/CartContext/CartContext.jsx) but not using them since it was already using the [useCart](file:///c:/Users/YASHASVI/Downloads/FOODIEFRENZY/FOODIEFRENZY/frontend/src/CartContext/CartContext.jsx) hook.
- **Solution**: Removed the unnecessary imports to clean up the code.

### 3. Unused Icon Imports
- **Problem**: The file was importing additional icons (`FaStar`, `FaHeart`, `FaShoppingCart`, `FaTimes`) that were not being used in the main component.
- **Solution**: Removed the unused icon imports.

## Verification Steps

3. Checked that the MenuItemDetail component exists and is properly implemented
4. Confirmed that the OurMenu component correctly imports and uses MenuItemDetail
5. Started all services using the run-all.ps1 script
