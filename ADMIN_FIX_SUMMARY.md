# Admin Panel Fix Summary

## Issue

The admin panel was showing a "React is not defined" error in the browser console, specifically:

```
Uncaught ReferenceError: React is not defined
    at dummyadmin.jsx:9:43
```

## Root Cause

In Vite-based React applications, when JSX syntax is used (like React icons `<FiPlusCircle />`), React must be explicitly imported even if not directly referenced in the code. The [dummyadmin.jsx](file:///Users/quick/Downloads/FOODIEFRENZY/admin/src/assets/dummyadmin.jsx) file was using React icons but missing the React import.

## Fix Applied

Added the missing React import to the [admin/src/assets/dummyadmin.jsx](file:///Users/quick/Downloads/FOODIEFRENZY/admin/src/assets/dummyadmin.jsx) file:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import {
  FiPlusCircle,
  FiList,
  FiPackage,
  FiTruck,
  FiCheckCircle,
  FiClock,
} from "react-icons/fi";
```

## Files Checked

All components in the admin panel properly import React:

- [AddItems.jsx](file:///Users/quick/Downloads/FOODIEFRENZY/admin/src/components/AddItems/AddItems.jsx) ✅
- [ListItems.jsx](file:///Users/quick/Downloads/FOODIEFRENZY/admin/src/components/ListItems/ListItems.jsx) ✅
- [Orders.jsx](file:///Users/quick/Downloads/FOODIEFRENZY/admin/src/components/Orders/Orders.jsx) ✅
- [Navbar.jsx](file:///Users/quick/Downloads/FOODIEFRENZY/admin/src/components/Navbar/Navbar.jsx) ✅

Only [dummyadmin.jsx](file:///Users/quick/Downloads/FOODIEFRENZY/admin/src/assets/dummyadmin.jsx) was missing the React import.

## Current Status

The admin panel is now running on http://localhost:5175 (port changed due to 5174 being in use) and should be working properly without the React error.

## Reference

This fix follows the project memory requirement:

> "In Vite-based React applications, React must be explicitly imported in main.jsx and any other files using JSX syntax to avoid 'React is not defined' errors, even if not directly referenced in code."
