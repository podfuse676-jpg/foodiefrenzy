### 2. Detailed View Flavor Selection
- Items with flavor options show a dedicated "Flavor Options" section
- Custom-styled checkboxes with clear visual feedback
- Support for multiple flavor selection
- Selected flavors are passed to the cart when added

### 3. Cart Integration

- Keyboard navigable checkboxes
- Clear visual feedback for selections
- Responsive design for all device sizes

## Technical Components

### New Components
1. **FlavorSelection.jsx** - Reusable component for displaying flavor options
2. **Updated MenuItem.jsx** - Integrated flavor selection in grid view
3. **Updated ItemDetailView.jsx** - Integrated flavor selection in detailed view
4. **Updated CartContext.jsx** - Enhanced to handle flavor selections

### Key Files Modified
- `frontend/src/components/OurMenu/MenuItem.jsx`
- `frontend/src/components/OurMenu/ItemDetailView.jsx`
- `frontend/src/CartContext/CartContext.jsx`
- `frontend/src/components/OurMenu/FlavorSelection.jsx` (new)

## Implementation Details

### Flavor Data Structure
Flavors are sourced from the `flavourOptions` array in each item object:
```javascript
{
  name: "Coffee",
  flavourOptions: ["Vanilla", "Chocolate", "Caramel", "Hazelnut"]
}
```

### State Management
- `selectedFlavors`: Array of currently selected flavor options
- `showFlavorOptions`: Boolean to toggle flavor selection visibility in grid view

### UI/UX Features
- Custom checkboxes with green checkmarks for clear selection feedback
- Collapsible flavor section in grid view to save space
- Responsive grid layout that works on all screen sizes
- Consistent styling with the existing application design

### Cart Integration
The cart system now supports flavor selections:
- Flavors are stored with each cart item
- Selected flavors are passed to the backend API
- Local storage fallback for non-authenticated users
- Flavors are preserved during cart operations (add, update, remove)

## Testing Verification

All components have been verified to work correctly:

- ✅ Flavor options display correctly for items with `flavourOptions`
- ✅ Custom checkboxes show clear selection states
- ✅ Multiple flavor selection works as expected
- ✅ Selected flavors are passed to the cart
- ✅ Flavors are preserved in cart items
- ✅ UI is responsive and accessible
- ✅ No flavor UI shows for items without flavor options
- ✅ Consistent styling with the rest of the application

## Access URLs
The application is now running with the new flavor selection feature:

- **Frontend Application**: http://localhost:5173
- **Admin Panel**: http://localhost:5174
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:4000

## How to Use the Feature

1. **In Menu Grid**:
   - Browse menu items
   - For items with flavors, click "Select Flavors"
   - Choose desired flavors from the checkboxes
   - Click "Add" to add item with selected flavors to cart

   - Select flavors from the "Flavor Options" section
   - Adjust quantity if needed
   - Click "Add to Cart"

## Backend Compatibility
The implementation works with the existing backend structure:
- Utilizes the existing `flavourOptions` field in the Item schema
- No backend changes required for basic functionality
- Maintains compatibility with current API endpoints

## Future Enhancements
Potential future improvements:
1. Single flavor selection mode
2. Premium flavor pricing
3. Flavor categories and grouping
4. Search functionality for items with many flavors
