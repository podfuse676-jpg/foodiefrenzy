## Understanding Your Excel Files

### lakeshore food menu.xlsx
This file contains prepared food and beverage items organized by category headers:
- Categories are identified by headers ending with a colon (e.g., "Hot Beverages:")
- Items are listed under their respective category headers
- Each item has:
  - Item name in the "ITEM" column
  - Price in the "PRICE" column
  - Description in the "Description" column (optional)
  - Flavour Options in the "Flavour Options" column (comma-separated)
  - GST status in the "GST (5%)" column (Yes/No)

### lakeshore convenience item.xlsx
This file contains convenience store items:
- All items are initially categorized as "Convenience"
- Items will be automatically re-categorized based on their names
- You may need to manually adjust some categorizations

## Processing Your Excel Data

### Step 1: Run the Import Script
The application has an enhanced import script that will process your Excel files and automatically categorize items:

1. Open a terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd c:\Users\YASHASVI\Downloads\FOODIEFRENZY\FOODIEFRENZY\backend
   ```
3. Run the import script:
   ```
   node importFromExcel.js
   ```

The script will:
- Read both Excel files
- Automatically categorize convenience items into appropriate categories
- Add modifier groups to items based on their categories
- Import all items into the MongoDB database

### Step 2: Verify Imported Data
After running the import script:

1. Access the admin panel at http://localhost:5174
2. Login with admin credentials
3. Navigate to "List Items" or "Manage Items"
4. Review the imported items to ensure:
   - Items are in the correct categories
   - Modifier groups have been added appropriately
   - Prices and descriptions are correct

### Step 3: Manual Adjustments (if needed)
Some items may need manual adjustment:

1. For items in the wrong category:
   - Edit the item
   - Change the category to one of the 11 required categories
   - Save the changes

2. For items missing modifier groups:
   - Edit the item
   - Add appropriate modifier groups (comma-separated)
   - Save the changes
